In this directory are the scripts and commands used to perform the final fine tuning of
our 3R multi-locus model, and calculate the expected ancestries.

   First we ran the command run_fine_scale0
This refits the best model from the iterative procedure, but it allows the position of the sites
to move around up to half a centimorgan

   Then we ran the command run_fine_scale1
This fits the model found by run_fine_scale0 but with the sites held back in place

   Finally we ran run_local_ancestry
Here, we took the model found by run_fine_scale1 and split it into two halves of the chromosome.
For each half, we calculated the expected local ancestry from the model, and from the samples.

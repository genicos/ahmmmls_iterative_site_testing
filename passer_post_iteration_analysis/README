In this directory are the scripts and commands used to perform the final fine tuning of
our 3R multi-locus model, and to calculate the expected ancestries.

   First we ran the command run_fine_scale0
This refits the best model from the iterative procedure, but it allows the position of the sites
to move around up to half a centimorgan.
fine_config0 is the model file used for this search.
OUT_fine0 is the output of this search.


   Then we ran the command run_fine_scale1
This fits the model found by run_fine_scale0 but with the sites held back in place
fine_config1 is the model file used for this search.
OUT_fine1 is the output of this search.

   Finally we ran run_local_ancestry
Here, we took the model found by run_fine_scale1 and split it into two halves of the chromosome.
For each half, we calculated the expected local ancestry from the model, and from the samples.
la_config_0 is the model file used for the first half of the chromosome.
la_config_1 is the model file used for the second half of the chromosome.
OUT_la_0 is the output for the first half of the chromosome.
OUT_la_1 is the output for the second half of the chromosome.
data_ancestry_peak_0.tsv is the average local ancestry across all samples for the model on the first half of the chromosome.
data_ancestry_peak_1.tsv is the average local ancestry across all samples for the model on the second half of the chromosome.
model_ancestry_peak_0.tsv is the expected local ancestry for the model on the first half of the chromosome.
model_ancestry_peak_1.tsv is the expected local ancestry for the model on the second half of the chromosome.

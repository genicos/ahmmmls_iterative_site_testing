In this directory are the scripts and commands used to perform the final fine tuning of
our multi-locus model, and to calculate the expected ancestries.

   First we ran the command run_fine_scale0
This refits the best model from the iterative procedure, but it allows the position of the sites
to move around up to half a centimorgan.
fine_config0 is the model file used for this search.
OUT_fine0 is the output of this search.


   Then we ran the command run_fine_scale1
This fits the model found by run_fine_scale0 but with the sites held back in place
fine_config1 is the model file used for this search.
OUT_fine1 is the output of this search.

   Finally we ran run_local_ancestry
We calculated the expected local ancestry from the model, and from the samples.
la_config is the model file used.
OUT_la is the output.
data_ancestry_model_9_25.tsv is the average local ancestry across all samples.
model_ancestry_model_9_25.tsv is the expected local ancestry for the model.
